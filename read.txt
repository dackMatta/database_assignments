database assignment week 13-16


conditional expressions  week 13 assignment
I performed the following querries in the following systematic approach

create database netflix_Ke;
use netflix_Ke;
imported the csv file into a new table named content
from the table,

select *
from content
where type='movie' and release_year>2017;

the above query returns a list of all movies released from 2017 henceforth 

select *
from content
where type='Tv Show' and country='United States';

the above query returns tv shows that originates from the united States

select *
from content
where type='Tv Show' and title='Dear White People';

the above query returns tv show with the title Dear White People

select *
from content
WHERE cast LIKE '%Vanessa Hudgens%';

the above query returns the cast with the name 'Vanessa Hudgens'

select *
from content
where rating='PG-13' and duration>90;

the above query returns the tv-shows with a rating of 'PG-13' and a duration above 90 minutes

select *
from content
where director='Haile Gerima';

the above querry returns shows directed by 'Haile Gerima'


SELECT 
    type,
    CASE 
        WHEN country = 'United States' AND release_year > 2010 THEN 'Timeless release'
        WHEN rating = 'TV-MA' AND listed_in = 'Documentaries' THEN ' Documentary hub enjoy'
        WHEN director = 'Bruno Garotti' THEN 'Directed by Bruno Garotti'
        ELSE 'Other'
    END AS category
FROM 
    content;

from the above querry, we select the type column from our table to work with
for the first condition when the country of origin is united states and the release_year is from 2010 we get a 'Timeless release' response 
likeise for the second condition when the rating is TV-MA and listed in documentaries it renders ' Documentary hub enjoy'
the last condition evaluates the directors name and returns the directed by 'directors name'
if the type does not meet any of the conditions the else condition is brought into action specifying the rows in the column doesnt meet the outlined conditions
